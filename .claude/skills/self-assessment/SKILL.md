# Self-Assessment & Learning Path Advisor

Comprehensive interactive assessment that evaluates Claude Code proficiency across 10 feature areas, identifies specific skill gaps, and generates a personalized learning path to level up.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Welcome & Choose Assessment Mode

Present the user with a choice of assessment depth:

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- **Quick Assessment** — "8 questions, ~2 minutes. Determines your overall level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) and gives a learning path."
- **Deep Assessment** — "5 categories with detailed questions, ~5 minutes. Gives per-topic skill scores, identifies specific gaps, and builds a prioritized learning path."

If user chooses **Quick Assessment**, go to Step 2A.
If user chooses **Deep Assessment**, go to Step 2B.

---

### Step 2A: Quick Assessment

Present TWO multi-select questions (AskUserQuestion supports max 4 options each):

**Question 1** (header: "Basics"):
"Part 1/2: Which of these Claude Code skills do you already have?"
Options:
1. "Start Claude Code and chat" — I can run `claude` and interact with it
2. "Created/edited CLAUDE.md" — I have set up project or user memory
3. "Used 3+ slash commands" — e.g., /help, /compact, /model, /clear
4. "Created custom command/skill" — Written a SKILL.md or custom command file

**Question 2** (header: "Advanced"):
"Part 2/2: Which of these advanced skills do you have?"
Options:
1. "Configured an MCP server" — e.g., GitHub, database, or other external data source
2. "Set up hooks" — Configured hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json
3. "Created/used subagents" — Used .claude/agents/ for task delegation
4. "Used print mode (claude -p)" — Used `claude -p` for non-interactive or CI/CD use

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 total = Level 1: Beginner
- 3-5 total = Level 2: Intermediate
- 6-8 total = Level 3: Advanced

Go to Step 3 with the level result, listing which specific items were NOT checked as gaps.

---

### Step 2B: Deep Assessment

Present 5 rounds of questions, one AskUserQuestion call per round. Each round covers 2 related feature areas. Use multi-select for all rounds.

**IMPORTANT**: AskUserQuestion supports max 4 options per question. Each round has exactly 1 question with 4 options covering 2 topics (2 options per topic).

---

**Round 1 — Slash Commands & Memory** (header: "Commands")

"Which of these have you done? Select all that apply."
Options:
1. "Created a custom slash command or skill" — Written a SKILL.md file with frontmatter, or created .claude/commands/ files

```markdown
## Claude Code Skill Assessment Results

### Overall Level: [Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3]

**Total Score: N/20 points**

[One-line motivational summary]

### Your Skill Profile

| Feature Area | Score | Mastery | Status |
|-------------|-------|---------|--------|
| Slash Commands | N/2 | [None/Basic/Proficient] | [Learn/Review/Mastered] |
| Memory | N/2 | [None/Basic/Proficient] | [Learn/Review/Mastered] |

**Mastery key:** 0 = None, 1 = Basic, 2 = Proficient

### Strength Areas
[List topics with score 2/2 — these are mastered]

### Priority Gaps (Learn Next)
[List topics with score 0 — these need attention first, ordered by dependency]

### Review Areas
[List topics with score 1/2 — basics known but advanced features not yet used]

### Your Personalized Learning Path

[Output gap-specific learning path — see Step 4]
```

**Overall level calculation for Deep Assessment:**
- 0-6 total points = Level 1: Beginner
- 7-13 total points = Level 2: Intermediate
- 14-20 total points = Level 3: Advanced

---

### Step 4: Generate Personalized Learning Path

Based on the assessment results, generate a learning path that is specific to the user's gaps. Do NOT just repeat the generic level path — adapt it.

#### Rules for Path Generation

1. **Skip mastered topics**: If a topic scored 2/2, do not include it in the path.
2. **Prioritize by dependency order**: Slash Commands before Skills, Memory before Subagents, etc. The dependency order is:
   - Slash Commands (no deps) -> Skills (depends on Slash Commands)
   - Memory (no deps) -> Subagents (depends on Memory)
   - CLI Basics (no deps) -> CLI Mastery (depends on all)
   - Checkpoints (no deps)
   - Hooks (depends on Slash Commands)
   - MCP (no deps) -> Plugins (depends on MCP, Skills, Hooks)
   - Advanced Features (depends on all previous)
3. **For score 1/2 topics**: Recommend the "deep dive" — link to the specific advanced section they're missing.
4. **Estimate time**: Sum only the topics they need to learn/review.
5. **Group into phases**: Organize remaining topics into logical phases of 2-3 topics each.

#### Path Output Format

```markdown
### Your Personalized Learning Path

**Estimated time**: ~N hours (adjusted for your current skills)

#### Phase 1: [Phase Name] (~N hours)
[Only if they have gaps in these areas]

**[Topic Name]** — [Learn from scratch / Deep dive into advanced features]
- Tutorial: [link to tutorial directory]
- Focus on: [specific sections/concepts they need]
- Key exercise: [one concrete exercise to do]
- You'll know it's done when: [specific success criterion]

**[Topic Name]** — ...

#### Phase 2: [Phase Name] (~N hours)

### Step 5: Offer Follow-up Actions

After presenting results, ask the user what they'd like to do next:

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- **Start learning** — "Help me begin the first topic in my learning path right now"
- **Deep dive on a gap** — "Explain one of my gap areas in detail so I can learn it here"
- **Practice project** — "Set up a practice project that covers my gap areas"
- **Retake assessment** — "I want to retake the quiz (maybe the other mode)"

If **Start learning**: Read the README.md of the first gap tutorial and walk the user through the first exercise.
If **Deep dive on a gap**: Ask which gap topic, then read the relevant tutorial README.md and explain the key concepts with examples.
If **Practice project**: Design a small project that combines 2-3 of their gap topics with concrete steps.
If **Retake assessment**: Go back to Step 1.

## Error Handling

### User selects no items in a round
Treat as 0 points for that round's topics. Continue to next round.

### User selects no items in any round
Assign Level 1: Beginner. Encourage starting from the beginning. Output the full Level 1 path.

### User wants to retake
Re-run from Step 1 with a fresh assessment.

### User disagrees with their level
Acknowledge their preference. Ask which level they identify with. Present the path for their chosen level with a prerequisites check for topics they may have missed.

### User asks about a specific topic
If the user says something like "tell me about hooks" or "I want to learn MCP" during the assessment, note it. After presenting results, highlight that topic in their learning path regardless of score.

## Validation

### Triggering test suite

**Should trigger:**
- "assess my level"
- "take the quiz"
- "find my level"
- "where should I start"
- "what level am I"
- "learning path quiz"
- "self-assessment"
- "what should I learn next"
- "check my skills"
- "skill check"
- "level up"
- "how good am I at Claude Code"
- "evaluate my Claude Code knowledge"

**Should NOT trigger:**
- "review my code"
- "create a skill"
- "help me with MCP"
- "explain slash commands"
- "what is a checkpoint"
