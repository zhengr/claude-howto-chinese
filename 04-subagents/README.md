## Overview

Subagents enable delegated task execution in Claude Code by:

- Creating **isolated AI assistants** with separate context windows
- Providing **customized system prompts** for specialized expertise
- Enforcing **tool access control** to limit capabilities
- Preventing **context pollution** from complex tasks
- Enabling **parallel execution** of multiple specialized tasks

Each subagent operates independently with a clean slate, receiving only the specific context necessary for their task, then returning results to the main agent for synthesis.

**Quick Start**: Use the `/agents` command to create, view, edit, and manage your subagents interactively.

---

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Context preservation** | Operates in separate context, preventing pollution of main conversation |
| **Specialized expertise** | Fine-tuned for specific domains with higher success rates |
| **Reusability** | Use across different projects and share with teams |
| **Flexible permissions** | Different tool access levels for different subagent types |
| **Scalability** | Multiple agents work on different aspects simultaneously |

---

## File Locations

Subagent files can be stored in multiple locations with different scopes:

| Type | Location | Scope | Priority |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Project subagents** | `.claude/agents/` | Current project | Highest |
| **User subagents** | `~/.claude/agents/` | All projects | Lower |
| **Plugin agents** | `plugins/agents/` | Via plugins | Varies |
| **CLI-defined** | Via `--agents` flag | Session-specific | Medium |

When duplicate names exist, project-level subagents take priority over user-level ones.

---

## Configuration

### File Format

Subagents are defined in YAML frontmatter followed by the system prompt in markdown:

```yaml
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
disallowedTools: tool4  # Optional - explicitly disallowed tools
model: sonnet  # Optional - sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit
permissionMode: default  # Optional - permission mode
maxTurns: 20  # Optional - limit agentic turns
skills: skill1, skill2  # Optional - skills to preload into context
mcpServers: server1  # Optional - MCP servers to make available
memory: user  # Optional - persistent memory scope (user, project, local)
background: false  # Optional - run as background task
isolation: worktree  # Optional - git worktree isolation
hooks:  # Optional - component-scoped hooks
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/security-check.sh"
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier (lowercase letters and hyphens) |
| `description` | Yes | Natural language description of purpose. Include "use PROACTIVELY" to encourage automatic invocation |
| `tools` | No | Comma-separated list of specific tools. Omit to inherit all tools. Supports `Task(agent_name)` syntax to restrict spawnable subagents |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Comma-separated list of tools the subagent must not use |
| `model` | No | Model to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`. Defaults to configured subagent model |
| `permissionMode` | No | `default`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`, `ignore` |
| `maxTurns` | No | Maximum number of agentic turns the subagent can take |
| `skills` | No | Comma-separated list of skills to preload. Injects full skill content into the subagent's context at startup |
| `mcpServers` | No | MCP servers to make available to the subagent |
| `hooks` | No | Component-scoped hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) |
| `memory` | No | Persistent memory directory scope: `user`, `project`, or `local` |
| `background` | No | Set to `true` to always run this subagent as a background task |
| `isolation` | No | Set to `worktree` to give the subagent its own git worktree |

### Tool Configuration Options

**Option 1: Inherit All Tools (omit the field)**
```yaml
---
name: full-access-agent
description: Agent with all available tools
---
```

**Option 2: Specify Individual Tools**
```yaml
---
name: limited-agent
description: Agent with specific tools only
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
```

**Option 3: Conditional Tool Access**
```yaml
---
name: conditional-agent
description: Agent with filtered tool access
tools: Read, Bash(npm:*), Bash(test:*)
---
```

### CLI-Based Configuration

Define subagents for a single session using the `--agents` flag with JSON format:

```bash
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  }
}'
```

**JSON Format for `--agents` flag:**

```json
{
  "agent-name": {
    "description": "Required: when to invoke this agent",
    "prompt": "Required: system prompt for the agent",
    "tools": ["Optional", "array", "of", "tools"],
    "model": "optional: sonnet|opus|haiku"
  }
}
```

**Priority of Agent Definitions:**

Agent definitions are loaded with this priority order (first match wins):
1. **CLI-defined** - `--agents` flag (session-specific)
2. **User-level** - `~/.claude/agents/` (all projects)
3. **Project-level** - `.claude/agents/` (current project)

This allows CLI definitions to override both user and project agents for a single session.

## Built-in Subagents

Claude Code includes several built-in subagents that are always available:

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **general-purpose** | Inherits | Complex, multi-step tasks |
| **Plan** | Inherits | Research for plan mode |
| **Explore** | Haiku | Read-only codebase exploration (quick/medium/very thorough) |
| **Bash** | Inherits | Terminal commands in separate context |

## Managing Subagents

### Using the `/agents` Command (Recommended)

```bash
/agents
```

This provides an interactive menu to:
- View all available subagents (built-in, user, and project)
- Create new subagents with guided setup
- Edit existing custom subagents and tool access
- Delete custom subagents
- See which subagents are active when duplicates exist

### Direct File Management

```bash
# Create a project subagent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cat > .claude/agents/test-runner.md << 'EOF'
---
name: test-runner
description: Use proactively to run tests and fix failures
---

You are a test automation expert. When you see code changes, proactively
run the appropriate tests. If tests fail, analyze the failures and fix
them while preserving the original test intent.
EOF

# Create a user subagent (available in all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

---

## Using Subagents

### Automatic Delegation

Claude proactively delegates tasks based on:
- Task description in your request
- The `description` field in subagent configurations
- Current context and available tools

To encourage proactive use, include "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in your `description` field:

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Use PROACTIVELY after writing or modifying code.
---
```

### Explicit Invocation

You can explicitly request a specific subagent:

```
> Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
> Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
> Ask the debugger subagent to investigate this error
```

---

## Resumable Agents

Subagents can continue previous conversations with full context preserved:

```bash
# Initial invocation
> Use the code-analyzer agent to start reviewing the authentication module
# Returns agentId: "abc123"

# Resume the agent later
> Resume agent abc123 and now analyze the authorization logic as well
```

**Use cases**:
- Long-running research across multiple sessions
- Iterative refinement without losing context
- Multi-step workflows maintaining context

---

## Chaining Subagents

Execute multiple subagents in sequence:

```bash
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues,
  then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

This enables complex workflows where the output of one subagent feeds into another.

---

## Persistent Memory for Subagents

The `memory` field gives subagents a persistent directory that survives across conversations. This allows subagents to build up knowledge over time, storing notes, findings, and context that persist between sessions.

### Memory Scopes

| Scope | Directory | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `user` | `~/.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` | Personal notes and preferences across all projects |
| `project` | `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` | Project-specific knowledge shared with the team |
| `local` | `.claude/agent-memory-local/<name>/` | Local project knowledge not committed to version control |

### How It Works

- The first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` in the memory directory are automatically loaded into the subagent's system prompt
- The `Read`, `Write`, and `Edit` tools are automatically enabled for the subagent to manage its memory files
- The subagent can create additional files in its memory directory as needed

### Example Configuration

```yaml
---
name: researcher
memory: user
---

You are a research assistant. Use your memory directory to store findings,
track progress across sessions, and build up knowledge over time.

Check your MEMORY.md file at the start of each session to recall previous context.
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Subagent<br/>Session 1"] -->|writes| M["MEMORY.md<br/>(persistent)"]
    M -->|loads into| B["Subagent<br/>Session 2"]
    B -->|updates| M
    M -->|loads into| C["Subagent<br/>Session 3"]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style B fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style C fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style M fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#333,color:#333
```

---

## Background Subagents

Subagents can run in the background, freeing up the main conversation for other tasks.

### Configuration

Set `background: true` in the frontmatter to always run the subagent as a background task:

```yaml
---
name: long-runner
background: true
description: Performs long-running analysis tasks in the background
---
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` | Background a currently running subagent task |
| `Ctrl+F` | Kill all background agents (press twice to confirm) |

### Disabling Background Tasks

Set the environment variable to disable background task support entirely:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1
```

---

## Worktree Isolation

The `isolation: worktree` setting gives a subagent its own git worktree, allowing it to make changes independently without affecting the main working tree.

### Configuration

```yaml
---
name: feature-builder
isolation: worktree
description: Implements features in an isolated git worktree
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---
```

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph TB
    Main["Main Working Tree"] -->|spawns| Sub["Subagent with<br/>Isolated Worktree"]
    Sub -->|makes changes in| WT["Separate Git<br/>Worktree + Branch"]
    WT -->|no changes| Clean["Auto-cleaned"]
    WT -->|has changes| Return["Returns worktree<br/>path and branch"]

    style Main fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style Sub fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style WT fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style Clean fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#333,color:#333
    style Return fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#333,color:#333
```

- The subagent operates in its own git worktree on a separate branch
- If the subagent makes no changes, the worktree is automatically cleaned up
- If changes exist, the worktree path and branch name are returned to the main agent for review or merging

---

## Restrict Spawnable Subagents

You can control which subagents a given subagent is allowed to spawn by using the `Agent(agent_type)` syntax in the `tools` field. This provides a way to allowlist specific subagents for delegation.

> **Note**: In v2.1.63, the `Task` tool was renamed to `Agent`. Existing `Task(...)` references still work as aliases.

### Example

```yaml
---
name: coordinator
description: Coordinates work between specialized agents
tools: Agent(worker, researcher), Read, Bash
---

You are a coordinator agent. You can delegate work to the "worker" and
"researcher" subagents only. Use Read and Bash for your own exploration.
```

In this example, the `coordinator` subagent can only spawn the `worker` and `researcher` subagents. It cannot spawn any other subagents, even if they are defined elsewhere.

---

## `claude agents` CLI Command

The `claude agents` command lists all configured agents grouped by source (built-in, user-level, project-level):

```bash
claude agents
```

This command:
- Shows all available agents from all sources
- Groups agents by their source location
- Indicates **overrides** when an agent at a higher priority level shadows one at a lower level (e.g., a project-level agent with the same name as a user-level agent)

---

## Agent Teams (Experimental)

Agent teams allow multiple agents to work together on complex tasks, coordinating across separate contexts.

### Enabling Agent Teams

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

### Display Mode

Control how teammate activity is displayed using the `--teammate-mode` flag:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` | Automatically choose the best display mode |
| `in-process` | Show teammate output inline in the current terminal |
| `tmux` | Show each teammate in a separate tmux pane |

```bash
claude --teammate-mode tmux
```

> **Note**: Agent teams is an experimental feature and may change in future releases.

---

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    User["User"]
    Main["Main Agent<br/>(Coordinator)"]
    Reviewer["Code Reviewer<br/>Subagent"]
    Tester["Test Engineer<br/>Subagent"]
    Docs["Documentation<br/>Subagent"]

    User -->|asks| Main
    Main -->|delegates| Reviewer

    Main -->|delegates| Docs
    Reviewer -->|returns result| Main
    Tester -->|returns result| Main
    Docs -->|returns result| Main
    Main -->|synthesizes| User
```

### Subagent Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant MainAgent as Main Agent
    participant CodeReviewer as Code Reviewer<br/>Subagent
    participant Context as Separate<br/>Context Window

    User->>MainAgent: "Build new auth feature"
    MainAgent->>MainAgent: Analyze task
    MainAgent->>CodeReviewer: "Review this code"
    CodeReviewer->>Context: Initialize clean context
    Context->>CodeReviewer: Load reviewer instructions
    CodeReviewer->>CodeReviewer: Perform review
    CodeReviewer-->>MainAgent: Return findings
    MainAgent->>MainAgent: Incorporate results
    MainAgent-->>User: Provide synthesis
```

---

## Context Management

```mermaid
graph TB
    A["Main Agent Context<br/>50,000 tokens"]
    B["Subagent 1 Context<br/>20,000 tokens"]
    C["Subagent 2 Context<br/>20,000 tokens"]
    D["Subagent 3 Context<br/>20,000 tokens"]

    A -->|Clean slate| B
    A -->|Clean slate| C
    A -->|Clean slate| D

    B -->|Results only| A
    C -->|Results only| A
    D -->|Results only| A

    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style B fill:#fff9c4
    style C fill:#fff9c4
    style D fill:#fff9c4
```

### Key Points

- Each subagent gets a **fresh context window** without the main conversation history
- Only the **relevant context** is passed to the subagent for their specific task
- Results are **distilled** back to the main agent
- This prevents **context token exhaustion** on long projects

### Performance Considerations

- **Context efficiency** - Agents preserve main context, enabling longer sessions
- **Latency** - Subagents start with clean slate and may add latency gathering initial context

---

## When to Use Subagents

| Scenario | Use Subagent | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Complex feature with many steps | Yes | Separate concerns, prevent context pollution |
| Quick code review | No | Unnecessary overhead |
| Parallel task execution | Yes | Each subagent has own context |
| Specialized expertise needed | Yes | Custom system prompts |
| Long-running analysis | Yes | Prevents main context exhaustion |
| Single task | No | Adds latency unnecessarily |

---

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

**Do:**
- Start with Claude-generated agents - Generate initial subagent with Claude, then iterate to customize
- Design focused subagents - Single, clear responsibilities rather than one doing everything
- Write detailed prompts - Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints
- Limit tool access - Grant only necessary tools for the subagent's purpose
- Version control - Check project subagents into version control for team collaboration

**Don't:**
- Create overlapping subagents with same roles
- Give subagents unnecessary tool access
- Use subagents for simple, single-step tasks
- Mix concerns in one subagent's prompt
- Forget to pass necessary context

### System Prompt Best Practices

1. **Be Specific About Role**
   ```
   You are an expert code reviewer specializing in [specific areas]
   ```

2. **Define Priorities Clearly**
   ```
   Review priorities (in order):
   1. Security Issues
   2. Performance Problems
   3. Code Quality
   ```

3. **Specify Output Format**
   ```
   For each issue provide: Severity, Category, Location, Description, Fix, Impact
   ```

4. **Include Action Steps**
   ```
   When invoked:
   1. Run git diff to see recent changes
   2. Focus on modified files
   3. Begin review immediately
   ```

### Tool Access Strategy

1. **Start Restrictive**: Begin with only essential tools
2. **Expand Only When Needed**: Add tools as requirements demand
3. **Read-Only When Possible**: Use Read/Grep for analysis agents
4. **Sandboxed Execution**: Limit Bash commands to specific patterns
